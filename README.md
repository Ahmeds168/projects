It contains project from datacamp in which we create credit card approval model

Caltech Original Prepared: This is object detection project in which we detect some objects such as accordian, aeroplane, pyramid, canon, camera, crab, cup, dragonfly and many more. First of all we divide the dataset into train, test, validation. Then we create a sequential model. Then we apply data augmentation. Then we run 100 epochs (15 steps per epoch). Then we run the model. Then we save the model as h5 file. Then we predict the images. Then we visualize the train and validation accuracy as well as train and validation loss.
